# Folder structure

Please adhere to a certain folder structure when adding new models, since the darttracker automatically searches this folder and subfolders for models. 
Structure: 

-> models
----> model1
--------> model1.xml
--------> model1.obj
----> model2
--------> model2.xml
--------> model2.obj

Note: the .obj files do not necessarily need to be situated in the same folder as the .xml file, the correct path needs to be specified in the latter file though.
